Team 3: Xinping Yu, Ruchika Venkateswaran, Yigit Demiralp, Bosoo Kim, Muyan Xie

## Introduction and Motivation
The dataset chosen by our group will be used in the field of “Human Resource Analytics”.Our primary goal is to utilize the dataset to predict whether a candidate training for a data science position will accept or reject a full time offer from the company. The dataset has been compiled by a data-related company that is aiming to reduce the time and cost spent by the human resources division to rain candidates who are potential full time employees. In addition, we will also discuss how these factors impact a candidate’s decision to stay and which is the most significant factor. We will also be using the most important features to predict the city development index. Generally, cities that are more developed provide a fertile ground for the development of science, technology, culture, and innovation. The prediction of the city development index can provide HR teams with deeper insight on whether they should train candidates who belong to cities with higher development indexes.
